# MATH360 Modelling

## Description
In this project, I will be posting notebooks from MATH 360 in University of British Columbia. These project will consist of ___ parts. The first part is to organize and add the example that I found very interesting or mathematically appealing to me. The second part is modelling from practice problems in which I will be going through the process that I learned in class. Additionally, Python will be used in this project for analyzing the results of the models.
The 6 processes are used and these are:
1. Providing **problem statements**
2. Organize **variables and parameters (constants)**
3. Describe any **assumptions and constraints**
4. Build **solutions**
5. Conduct **analysis and assesses**
6. **Report results**

Within this process, First Order Transformation and Nondimensionalization will be adequately applied after building solutions. 
The purpose of first order transformation is to make it easy to plot the results. Also, nondimensionalization is the process of scaling variables in a differential equation to simplify the model. With these two methods, the models can be easily computed and calculated.
